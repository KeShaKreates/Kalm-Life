THIS  IS YOUR 100 HOURS PROJECT KALM LIFE


LOOK @ docs for help always!


8/8 
Major breakthrough when reviewing BUB 
- the reason you couldnt get the journal entry to work properly is becaus eth post model is requirng things you dont need
- this a reminder to check all code related to whatevr is being built to ensure it has eveything you need and nothign that you dont!!!!
- add ejs, mvc,  to skills in linkedin
- stopped reviewing at views i hav e?s about sign up, post and todos
- why when i changed the requirement from true to false it went through? this is not good the journals will not be saved for the user to reference later
- Also the journals have no where to be shown on the page
-  use all post code to create the journal entries the feed will be a page full of the user's previous journal entries  ??
- left off trying to get journal entries to display on the feed

8/9 
- left off trying to figure out the reference error jorunals not defined
    - i think it has something to do with the main.js routes ?

8/10
- i dont know why it wont work but what i do know is that the issue with the database valdiation and jounrals not being defined are most likely connected. fix one then the other will be fixed too.

8/11 
- think i finally figured it out journals does not have a view like posts does 
- added journal.ejs but i am tired so i decided to work on cleaning up the css on the profile page 
- carosuel wont display images

8/12

- i keep noticing that with the header pop ut certian things sit on top of it instead of under

8/14 
- left off editing posts to be for journals & cleaning up the post.ejs views and trying to make fork private because this is the perfect spot to push 

8/15
- Succesfully updates posts to journalposts!

FIX INDEX PAGE


CSS NOTES:
- for all h1/h2 headings at the to of page  my-10
- ultioze https://refero.design/157-scale.com/4635
  }
THIS makes the buttons and form look AMAZING
  button id="healing-button-spiritualist" class="sad col-3 btn  btn-ghost flex justify-center my-3 ring-4 ring-primary ring-offset-4 ring-offset-base-100
    .mask-squircle  
    {
     min-height: 500px;
     min-width: 500px;
     /* box-shadow: 10px 10px 10px 10px black; */
     filter: drop-shadow( #a3bfb2 1rem 1rem 10px);
   }

What still needs to be done:

- a background will really liven it up
- bring it to life and play with diff css alginemnts and sizes
- update text size & weight
- find a better font (very last)
- create logo that can be clicked and will take user back to index page (only clickable when not logged in) 
- DONT FORGET TO UPDATE THE CONTENT THE WORDS HOE!!!!
- index page is very important give it lifeeee!
- dont forget to make sure all the code is updated for EACH belief


- Clean up code base
  - add commnet sto codebase while cleaning up as well
    - if issue in int say i comment my code base just to remebr what evetyhign does  

  - Double Check all pages on website for bugs check at diff screen sizes as well!
  - Double check all files !!!


 OPTIMIZATIONS:
 - add more options for mood
 - add more religions
  - optimization will be a mor ethrough tracker where it would show a daily track of what healign technuies the user completd that day
  -  udpate cdoe tow ehere the user bhealign epxercine woudl be tailored to their belifs starting from the user files instead of just baseing it off of the mood dropdown 
  - use religion api to pull in more dtata 
  - use healign techniue api to pull in more dtata


EXTRA NOTES:
 - add jquery to skills and ejs
