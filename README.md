# Kalm Life

## Description

A full-stack web application that focuses on bettering the userâ€™s mental state.

## Tools Used:

- Tailwind
- Javascript
- jQuery
- EJS
- Node.js
- Express.js 
- MongoDB

## Optimizations:
I would optimize this application by adding more belief systems and mental health illnesses so it could be more inclusive. I would have also made each user's experience more unique by updating the user interface based on not only their belief system but their mental health illness as well.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to set up the back end of an application all while making sure that the front end's user interface was efficient and effective.
